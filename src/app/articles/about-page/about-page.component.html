        <p>Hi all!</p>
        <p>This is my personal site for anything I feel like publishing or blabbing about. I plan to upload some of my projects, hobbies, comments, blogs, listicles, and generally anything I find of interest.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<P>IRL my name is Michael Sparks (he/him 24), I am a fullstack software developer by trade (Angular 2+, Springboot, PostreSQL). I have a degree in CS from UNC Chapel-Hill and am currently working on my MBA.</P>
<p>When I'm not working for my corporate overlords I enjoy meetups, skating, gym, piano, and whatever hobby I randomly have fallen into for the month. If you give me the chance to attend a potluck Iâ€™ll show you why sides > dessert.</p>
